# Context is everything
Paradigm choice and the "best" technical solutions

Lets tour the programming paradimgs and their impact on programming langauges and people creating software. As a parallel, How has science evolved? Can we draw from that?


- concern that learning many paradigms is harder than learning one well?
economy of language (some langauges are easier to learn from a paradigm point of view)

how to choose the correct readability context?
Waht is a paradigm

Do you learn more by using a language you like or one you don't?

Do all systems have cruft? ie in production they have at least some elements of non elegance?
What does it mean production code?

What is utopia then? from a PL perspective? what does the perfect langauge look like? I think
the perfect langauge
- has all the paradigms
- can be changed
- it's simple (what does simple even mean?) .. maybe this can be reworded as thre are well isolated units of complexity?


examples
from high to low level abstractions

maybe show the erlang exmaple of sending the message and the
hindley milner in prolog example  and then racket to 6502 adn how we cna go from higher to lower abstractions levels
