### Computation expressions in practice

Handling errors, asynchronous computations, and hiding the behind-the-scenes plumbing are just some of the use cases of computation expressions. They can be a little bit tricky to learn, specially at the start.

In this hands-on workshop we'll learn how to use some common computation expressions with varying levels of difficulty and then learn how to roll our own computation expressions from scratch.
